# Getting Started with React


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run lint`

Launches ESlint to check potential JS problems/issues in your project

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run preview`

It will run in a server a preview of your project ready for production environment reading the files generated previously (of _dist_ folder) with the `build` command.
